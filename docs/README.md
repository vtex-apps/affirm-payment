# Affirm Payment

This is a payment authorization app for the Affirm payment method (financing with monthly payments). By installing this app, the [Affirm payment connector app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/affirm-api) will also be automatically installed as a dependency.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _Currently Affirm cannot be used in a marketplace scenario where the seller account processes the payment. In marketplace scenarios, the marketplace account must process the payment._

## Configuration

1. [Install this app](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/installing-an-app/) in your account by running `vtex install vtex.affirm-payment`.
2. Enable Affirm as a payment method in your store admin. In the Gateway Affiliation, enter your Affirm public API key as the `Application Key` and your Affirm private API key as the `Application Token`. For initial testing, set the Test/Production toggle to `Test` and use sandbox keys.
3. Configure the app settings by clicking `Apps > My Apps` in your account's admin sidebar and then selecting `Affirm Payment`.

The available settings are:

- `Enable Katapult`: Katapult is a newer Affirm feature that offers a leasing option to shoppers who do not qualify for the normal Affirm financing. Please ask your Affirm contact to enable the feature on your Affirm account before enabling this app setting.
- `Company Name`: If you have multiple sites operating under a single Affirm account, you can override the external company/brand name that the customer sees. This affects all references to your company name in the Affirm UI. Leave blank to use your default company name stored in your Affirm account.
- `Public API Key for promotional components`: The public API key provided to you by Affirm.
- `Production Mode for promotional components`: Determines if the components from the [Affirm Components](https://github.com/vtex-apps/affirm-components) app run in Production or Sandbox mode.
- `Interval to use for the following three settings`: Determines the unit of time used by the following settings.
- `Delay to automatic payment capture`: Number of minutes/hours/days before authorized Affirm payments are automatically settled.
- `Delay to automatic payment capture after antifraud analysis`: Number of minutes/hours/days before authorized Affirm payments are automatically settled after merchant's antifraud approval.
- `Delay to cancel`: Number of minutes/hours/days before Affirm payments are automatically canceled.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è _`Delay to cancel` also affects the amount of time the user is given to complete the Affirm checkout modal. As such, the app will enforce a minimum `delay to cancel` time of 60 minutes. Shorter times may be inputted on the settings page, but they will be ignored. Also, times longer than 1 day should not be used._
- `Katapult public token`: The public API token for your Katapult account. This is only needed if Katapult is enabled.
- `Katapult private token`: The private API token for your Katapult account. This is only needed if Katapult is enabled.
- `Partial cancellation`: Feature flag to enable partial cancellation feature, which when enabled, ensures that the amount for partially canceled items on order is voided during settlement.
